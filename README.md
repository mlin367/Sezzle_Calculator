# Sezzle_Calculator
Coding Challenge for Sezzle

The calculation log is not persisted in a database or anything so it resets whenever the server is shut down or restarted

To run (requires Node.js):

1. run npm install in root directory
2. run npm run build to build bundle
3. run npm start to start server
4. go to localhost:5000 to access the application
